# Giftify
Looking for that **perfect** gift, but don't know where to start? Well we have the perfect app for you!

## Installation
No installation required. Simply visit [Giftify] (https://giftify-project2.herokuapp.com/) and get started!


## Purpose
This application helps the user search for and buy the perfect gift for their special someone. They can choose from a selection of Featured and Top Rated Gifts, or they can search for a gift directly from the homepage. 


## Functionality
This page uses two different third-party APIs (**Etsy** and **Algolia**). The Etsy API allows the user to search for items by a keyword, then displays the results directly on the home page. Once a term is searched, it is stored in a recent searches table, which will allow the user to click a button and return to that search later.

Algolia allows the user to search through a defined array of gifts. It also serves as an auto-complete function, which will start displaying results as soon as the first key is typed.

Once the perfect gift is found, the gift-giver can click a link directing them to buy the item.
